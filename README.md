💡 Project Philosophy

   MindMate is not merely a chatbot. It's empathy-oriented, privacy-focused, and inclusive. All AI-derived observations are prompt, mood-sensitive, and English- and Hindi-language compliant. The responsive user interface provides equal access to all.

🚀 Getting Started

 bash

  -Clone the repository
     git clone https://github.com/Janani2436/mindmate-frontend.git
     cd mindmate-frontend
  -Install dependencies
     npm install
  -Copy the example .env file
     cp .env.example .env
  -(Replace with your API keys for OpenRouter, backend URL, etc.)
  -Start up the dev server
     npm start

  -The application is accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.
  -Make sure your backend is running and REACT_APP_API_URL environment variable is set properly.

🔑 Core User Flow

  -Register/Login: Secure JWT authentication.
  -Dashboard: View your chat, initiate sessions, see mood logs.
  -Start Chatting: AI listens, responds, and provides positive, context-aware support.
  -Express Yourself: Use voice input or emojis; get text-to-speech AI responses.
  -Mood & Journaling: Record moods with brief entries and view progress.
  -Session End: See chat summaries and wellness recommendations.

🏆 Why MindMate Stands Out

  -Inclusive & Multilingual: Multiple language support, prominently Hindi, to reach beyond English speakers.
  -AI Emotional Intelligence: Mood-sensitive, context-informed responses designed for authentic support.
  -Privacy-First: End-to-end encrypted chat; your emotional journey remains confidential.
  -Portfolio-Ready: Clean UI, up-to-date stack, and easily extensible—ideal for demos or career showcases.

📈 Future Improvements

  -Improved emotion analysis and visual mood trends.
  -Ability to schedule regular check-ins.
  -Dark mode and more accessibility features.
